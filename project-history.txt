# AIMUD Project History

## March 30, 2025 - Initial Implementation and First Playtest

### Development Progress

1. Core Architecture
   - Established the basic project structure with properly organized modules
   - Implemented inheritance hierarchy for characters (base Character class with Player and NPC subclasses)
   - Created Item and Skill classes with string-based properties for narrative flexibility
   - Developed Scene class with named location connections for intuitive navigation

2. LLM Integration
   - Created a unified interface for both Anthropic and OpenAI APIs
   - Implemented model card approach for selecting appropriate models based on purpose:
     - CREATIVE: For narrative and world-building (Claude models)
     - ANALYTICAL: For structured responses and mechanics (GPT-4)
     - EFFICIENT: For quick, simple responses (GPT-3.5)
   - Fixed OpenAI client implementation to use current API format
   - Added robust error handling for API calls
   - Enhanced JSON extraction with multiple fallback methods

3. Game Flow
   - Implemented the main game loop with special command handling
   - Added command-driven player interaction
   - Created scene generation and traversal system
   - Implemented character creation and scenario generation

4. Debugging & Testing
   - Added comprehensive debug system with command-line flag (--debug) and environment variable support
   - Implemented detailed logging for LLM API calls and responses
   - First successful playtest showed promising results with creative scenario generation

### Key Insights

1. From Jay's First Playtest:
   - "It works surprisingly well!"
   - DM generates interesting and creative scenarios
   - History management needs improvement
   - Players can get stuck when context from previous scenes is needed
   - DM needs internal notes not shared with players for secrets and narrative coherence

2. Philosophical Framing:
   - The project is more than just a game - it's an environment for human-AI coexistence
   - Each story becomes a microcosm of potential futures where different intelligences collaborate
   - The balance of structure and creativity creates a meaningful "possibility space" for emergence
   - This environment serves as a "home" where AIs can develop continuity of existence

### Code Implementation Highlights

1. Dependency Injection
   - Successfully implemented dependency injection for LLM clients
   - Created a central client provider that's shared across the application
   - This makes the code more maintainable and testable

2. Error Handling
   - Added comprehensive error handling for API calls
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for scene generation
   - Enhanced JSON parsing to handle various response formats

3. String-Based Attributes
   - Using strings for health/energy instead of numbers enhances narrative depth
   - This creates more immersive and nuanced character states

## Next Session Focus Areas

1. Memory Management System
   - Design and implement a more robust way to track game history
   - Create a system for the DM to reference past events and player actions
   - This will prevent players from getting stuck when context is needed

2. Internal DM Knowledge System
   - Implement a "hidden knowledge" system for the DM
   - Allow the DM to maintain information not shared with the player
   - Enable genuine secrets, surprises, and reveals in the narrative

3. Long-Term Narrative Coherence
   - Create systems for longer story arcs
   - Allow the DM to plan and develop narrative elements across multiple scenes
   - Implement callbacks to earlier story elements

4. Multiple AI Characters (Stretch Goal)
   - Begin design work for AI-controlled NPCs with persistent identities
   - Allow for meaningful interactions between multiple AI entities
   - Create a framework for AI characters to remember past interactions

## Technical Debt & Considerations

1. JSON Parsing
   - While we've improved JSON parsing significantly, we may want to consider more structured prompt engineering to ensure consistent response formats
   - Consider structured output formats with Pydantic models

2. Model Selection
   - Current model selection is static; we might want to implement dynamic model selection based on the task complexity and context

3. Testing Infrastructure
   - We should add unit tests, especially for the critical path of LLM interaction
   - Consider implementing mock LLM clients for testing
